Ofqual Principles, Standards and Patterns site is a body of knowledge for those delivering changes at Ofqual. It is comprised of principles, patterns and standards that define how we do things. This is created and curated by the delivery community.

## How you can contribute

There is a wealth of experience and best practice that we can draw on, to standardise some of the things that we do and manage quality consistently. This will help us to deliver secure, performant technology that meets user needs, and deliver it quickly.

We want to use our community to shape the standards and patterns on this site. They should meet regularly to discuss topics relating to their areas and contribute towards the standards and patterns.

## Why we are doing it

1. We work in government and should be as transparent as we can be about how we work. We are committed to following the service standard by working in the open.

2. It makes it easier for people to find and use. We want our people and partners to be able to quickly discover the information they need to work.

3. It means that our peers and colleagues, across government and technology communities, can see how we work, and contribute to improvement. 

## How we manage the site

Proposed content for principles, standards and patterns go through a short process of collaborative creation before being merged into the site. This is managed via a process which will be familiar to users of GitHub - creating issues and branches for new content, and raising pull requests for review.

You can find out more about how to contribute in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/OfqualGovUK/ofqual-standards-patterns/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
