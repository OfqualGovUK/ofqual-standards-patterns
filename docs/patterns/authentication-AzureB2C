<!-- Pattern description -->

Azure B2C Login

Azure Active Directory B2C Login
Infrastructure Setup
Azure B2C App Registrations
Create or Update the B2C App Registrations
We will need an app registration for all 3 environments (Dev, Preprod and Production)
Inside the registration, navigate to the authentication sidebar

App Registration Configuration Sidebar

Under Redirect URL's add the B2C callback path to the record, all should be appended with /signin-oidc

For Development, we will need to add 3 Redirect URIs to use:
a localhost HTTP redirect for CI Playwright testing
a localhost HTTPS redirect for local development and QA use
the full URL of the hosted development environment
For Production, only add the URL for the hosted environment
An example of a development environment setup should look something similar to this:
Platform Configuration Window

Add a Front-Channel logout URL, this should be similar to the Redirect URL for the hosted environment, substituting the /signin-oidc suffix with /signout-oidc
Enable Access Tokens and ID Token Checkboxes for Hybrid Flows
Ensure that public client flows are not allowed
Bottom of Platform Configuration Window

B2C SignUp/SignIn (SUSI) User flow
Create a sign up, sign in (SUSI) user flow

Under Properties, this should be configured as follows
Multifactor Authentication: Always On
MFA should always be on and configured for SMS and Calls
Age gating: Disabled
Password Configuration: Strong
CAPCHA (Preview): SignUp/SignIn
For security reasons, we have opted to enable CAPCHAS for now.
Configure application claims to contain the following:
Email Addresses
Display Name
User's Object ID
For development purposes, we will need to create a automated SUSI flow that will allow us to skip MFA and CAPTCHA during authentication
for convention, we can give it the same name as the typical user flow, suffixed with _automation
Under Properties, this should be configured as follows
Multifactor Authentication: Off
Age gating: Disabled
Password Configuration: Strong
CAPCHA (Preview): None
Setup page for User flows

Project Setup
Program.cs
The following packages should be included in the main project:
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect
Microsoft.Identity.Web
You will also need to bind the Azure B2C configuration and add the Authentication and Microsoft identity web app middleware

builder.Services.AddOptions();
builder.Services.Configure<OpenIdConnectOptions>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAdB2C"));
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(options =>
    {        
        builder.Configuration.Bind("AzureAdB2C", options);
        if (builder.Configuration.GetValue<bool?>("AzureAdB2C:UseAutomationPolicies") ?? false)        
            options.SignUpSignInPolicyId = builder.Configuration                
                .GetValue<string>("AzureAdB2C:SignUpSignInPolicyForAutomationId");        

        options.Events ??= new OpenIdConnectEvents();
        options.Events.OnRedirectToIdentityProvider += async (context) =>
        {            
            var token = context.Properties.Items.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Key == AuthConstants.TokenHintIdentifier).Value;
            if (token != null)
                context.ProtocolMessage.SetParameter(AuthConstants.TokenHintIdentifier, token);

            var redirectUri = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("AzureAdB2C:RedirectUri");
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(redirectUri))
                context.ProtocolMessage.RedirectUri = redirectUri + options.CallbackPath.Value;
            await Task.CompletedTask.ConfigureAwait(false);
        };
        options.SaveTokens = true;
    });
Finally, add the UseCookiePolicy and Authentication Middleware

app.CookiePolicy();
app.UseAuthentication();
Controllers/OfqualAccountController.cs
Add an authentication controller to the project with a Sign in and Sign out endpoint:

[AllowAnonymous]
[Area("MicrosoftIdentity")]
[Route("[Area]/[Controller]/[Action]")]
public class OfqualAccountController : Controller
{
    private readonly IOptionsMonitor<MicrosoftIdentityOptions> _optionsMonitor;
    public OfqualAccountController(IOptionsMonitor<MicrosoftIdentityOptions> optionsMonitor)
    {
        _optionsMonitor = optionsMonitor;        
    }

    [HttpGet("{scheme?}")]
    public IActionResult SignIn([FromRoute] string scheme)
    {
        scheme ??= OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        var redirectUrl = Url.Content("~/");
        var properties = new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = redirectUrl };
        properties.Items["policy"] = _optionsMonitor.CurrentValue.SignUpSignInPolicyId;
        return Challenge(properties, scheme);
    }

    [HttpGet("{scheme?}")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> SignOutAsync([FromRoute] string scheme)
    {
        scheme ??= OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;

        // obtain the id_token
        var idToken = await HttpContext.GetTokenAsync("id_token");
        // send the id_token value to the authentication middleware
        var redirectUrl = Url.Content("~/");
        var properties = new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = redirectUrl };
        properties.Items[AuthConstants.TokenHintIdentifier] = idToken;

        return SignOut(properties, CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, scheme);
    }
}
AzureAdB2C Appsetting/Environment Variables
Add the following settings
Instance: The URL of the B2C service used to authenticate.
ClientId: The Application ID of the service we will be running.
Domain: The domain we will be authenticating under.
SignUpSignInPolicyId: The policy name for the typical Sign up/Sign in flow.
SignUpSignInPolicyForAutomationId: The policy name for the automated Sign up/Sign in flow, this might be required but should not be set in production environments.
UseAutomationPolicies: This flag is used in development to determine if the application uses the typical or automated Sign up/Sign in flow. This should only be set to true when using automated testing.
CallBackPath: The callback path when signing in to Azure B2C, typically set to /signin-oidc
SignedOutCallbackPath: The callback path when signing out of Azure B2c, typically set to /signout-callback-oidc
RedirectUri: This is an optional parameter used to override the sign in redirect URI, We should not need to set this in most cases, however, we have had to implement this for development and CI Playwright testing as a workaround.
