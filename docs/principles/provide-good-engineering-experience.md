At Ofqual, we recognise that the we get the best outcomes relies on us getting many different aspects right.  We will invest in the continuous improvement of our colleague experience.

## Rationale

Delivering the right outcomes is more than tooling and platforms and technology meeting needs. It is affected by our working relationships, our community, our structures and our culture. We complete work quicker and at higher quality when the tools and environments provide the right capabilities and support. When we don't have those things, work moves more slowly, technical debt is accrued and security can be compromised. We want to reduce day-to-day friction and duplication, to improve productivity.

## Applications and Implications

- Look at the whole experience to understand how teams and organisation impact the work that they do, alongside the tools and services they consume
- Build an essential, community-driven body of knowledge to follow and refer to, promoting common patterns and paths to achieve objectives
