This accessibility statement applies to the Ofqual IM Principles, Standards and Patterns documentation site at [{{siteRoot}}]({{ siteRoot }}).

This website is run by the Ofqual. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- Navigate the website using just a keyboard
- Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
