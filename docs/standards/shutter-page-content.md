# Notes on linking to headings within a page

Heading tags are automatically assigned an id, converting spaces to `kebab-case` and applying URL encoding. If you want to link to a specific heading, you can obtain the URL encoded link by running the site locally, inspecting the appropriate <h3> element in the browser's developer tools and copying the value from the 'id' attribute.

This standard defines how the content for shutter pages (used to inform a user that a service is unavailable) should be written and presented.

## Requirements

<!-- Populate list for each requirement (there can be more than 2) -->

<!--

# Notes on anchor links

Use HTML URL encoding as in the 'Notes on links' above, to ensure that links to headers with punctuation works as expected. For example:

[Product documentation MUST include build, release and deployment processes](#product-documentation-must-include-build%2C-release-and-deployment-processes)

-->

- [Follow the GOV.UK design system pattern](#follow-the-govuk-design-system-pattern)
- [Be as specific as possible without being confusing](#be-as-specific-as-possible-without-being-confusing)
- [Choose a content template based on which service is unavailable](#choose-a-content-template-based-on-which-service-is-unavailable)

### Follow the GOV.UK design system pattern

The GOV.UK design system has a recommended [pattern for implementing shutter pages](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/service-unavailable-pages/) for GOV.UK services. Where possible, we should follow its best-practice recommendations.


### Be as specific as possible without being confusing

A shutter page is most helpful when it can inform the user why the service is unavailable, when it will be available again and what, if anything, has happened to any data the user has in the system. Language should meet standards set out in the [GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide) and be simple to understand. Where possible to do so, tell the user:

* the name of the service that is unavailable
* that the service is unavailable
* the day, date and time when the service will become available
* what has happened to their data, if they are in the middle of a process in the system
* contact information, if it is required to meet user needs
* links to alternative services that can help the user meet their need, if any exist

### Choose a content template based on which service is unavailable

Where a single service is unavailable, base your shutter page content on the appropriate template below to match the service.

Where multiple services are unavailable, base your content on the [multiple services](#multiple-services) template.
