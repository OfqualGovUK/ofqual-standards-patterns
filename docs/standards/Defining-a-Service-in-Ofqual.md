Ofqual services are defined as the full end-to-end journey that delivers an outcome for users. This includes all digital and non-digital components, systems, people, processes, and infrastructure required to meet a user need in line with government policy.

This definition is informed by the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/what-a-service-is).

The service definition comprises:

- User Outcomes, which are the intended results of a service, such as receiving a licence, registering to vote, or accessing support
- User Journeys, which include all interactions across channels (web, phone, post, face-to-face) that a user undertakes to achieve the outcome
- Service Components, which include systems, processes, staff activities, infrastructure, and support mechanisms
- Cross-Government Collaboration, as most services span multiple departments, agencies, and suppliers.
 

This definition ensures services are designed around user needs rather than organisational boundaries, and supports consistent assessment, improvement, and delivery across government.

Benefits of this Definition:

- Clarity of Scope: Services are not defined by a single transaction or interface, but by the full journey and outcome
- User-Centred Design: Enables teams to focus on what users need to achieve, not just what government provides
- Cross-Channel Consistency: Supports design and delivery across digital and non-digital touchpoints
- Alignment Across Government: Encourages collaboration and shared understanding across departments and professions

### Be defined by the outcome they deliver to users

- A service is not just a transaction or a website; it is the end-to-end journey that helps a user achieve a specific outcome.
- Outcomes can be one or all of:
  - Step-level (e.g. confirmation of application)
  - Government-level (e.g. eligibility confirmed)
  - Overall (e.g. user can legally drive)
- Services must be framed around what the user needs to achieve, not what Ofqual provides.

### Include all channels through which users interact (digital and non-digital)

- Services must include all relevant channels through which users interact; this may be digital-only or a mix of digital and non-digital, depending on the service’s scope and user needs.
- Where applicable, services should work consistently across:
  - Websites and apps
  - Phone and email
  - Post and face-to-face
  - Printed materials and signage
- The user experience must be coherent and consistent across all channels that are part of the service.
- Non-digital touchpoints should be considered where they are essential for accessibility, inclusion, or policy compliance, but are not mandatory if the service is designed to be fully digital and meets all user needs.

### Include all components required to deliver the outcome (systems, processes, people, infrastructure)

- A service includes everything needed to deliver the outcome:
  - Front-end systems (e.g. forms, portals)
  - Back-end systems (e.g. databases, case management)
  - Processes (e.g. verification, approvals)
  - People (e.g. caseworkers, support staff)
  - Infrastructure (e.g. buildings, networks)
- Internal staff-facing tools and workflows are part of the service, even if invisible to users.

### Be designed around user needs, not organisational structures

- Services must be shaped by what users need to do, not how Ofqual and wider linked departments are organised.
- Avoid designing services that reflect internal silos or legacy structures.
- Use user research to understand real-world journeys, pain points, and expectations.
- Services should feel joined-up, even if multiple departments are involved.

### Be assessed and improved using the Service Standard

The Service Standard provides a framework for:

- Designing services that meet user needs
- Ensuring accessibility, usability, and performance
- Iterating based on feedback and data
- New services must undergo Service Assessments at key stages (Alpha, Beta, Live).
- Continuous improvement is expected services are never “done”.
