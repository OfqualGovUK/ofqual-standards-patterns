Ofqual services are defined as the full end-to-end journey that delivers an outcome for users. This includes all digital and non-digital components, systems, people, processes, and infrastructure required to meet a user need in line with government policy.

This definition is informed by the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/what-a-service-is).

The service definition comprises:

- **user outcomes**, which are the intended results of a service, such as receiving a licence, registering to vote, or accessing support
- **user journeys**, which include all interactions across channels (web, phone, post, face-to-face) that a user undertakes to achieve the outcome
- **service components**, which include systems, processes, staff activities, infrastructure, and support mechanisms
- **cross-government collaboration**, as most services span multiple departments, agencies, and suppliers

This definition ensures services are designed around user needs rather than organisational boundaries, and supports consistent assessment, improvement, and delivery across government.

Benefits of this definition:

- **clarity of scope**: services are not defined by a single transaction or interface, but by the full journey and outcome
- **user-centred design**: enables teams to focus on what users need to achieve, not just what government provides
- **cross-channel consistency**: supports design and delivery across digital and non-digital touchpoints
- **alignment across government**: encourages collaboration and shared understanding across departments and professions

[Product documentation MUST include build, release and deployment processes](#product-documentation-must-include-build%2C-release-and-deployment-processes)

### Be defined by the outcome they deliver to users

A service must:

- be defined as the end-to-end journey that helps a user achieve a specific outcome; a service is not just a transaction or a website
- have one or more of these outcomes:
  - step-level (for example, confirmation of application)
  - government-level (for example, eligibility confirmed)
  - overall (for example, user can legally drive)
- be framed around what the user needs to achieve, not what Ofqual provides

### Include all channels through which users interact (digital and non-digital)

A service must:

- include all relevant channels through which users interact; this may be digital-only or a mix of digital and non-digital, depending on the service’s scope and user needs
- where applicable, work consistently across:
  - websites and apps
  - phone and email
  - post and face-to-face
  - printed materials and signage
- have a coherent and consistent the experience across all channels that are part of the service
- consider non-digital touchpoints where they are essential for accessibility, inclusion, or policy compliance, but are not mandatory if the service is designed to be fully digital and meets all user needs

### Include all components required to deliver the outcome (systems, processes, people, infrastructure)

A service must:

- include everything needed to deliver the outcome:
  - front-end systems (for example, forms, portals)
  - back-end systems (for example, databases, case management)
  - processes (for example, verification, approvals)
  - people (for example, caseworkers, support staff)
  - infrastructure (for example, buildings, networks)
- include all internal staff-facing tools and workflows that are part of the service, even if invisible to users

### Be designed around user needs, not organisational structures

A service must:

- be shaped by what users need to do, not how Ofqual and wider linked departments are organised
- avoid a design that reflects internal silos or legacy structures
- use user research to understand real-world journeys, pain points, and expectations
- feel joined-up, even if multiple departments are involved

### Be assessed and improved using the Service Standard

The [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) must be used as a framework for:

- designing services that meet user needs
- ensuring accessibility, usability, and performance
- iterating based on feedback and data
- new services must undergo service assessments at key stages (Alpha, Beta, Live)
- continuous improvement; it is expected that services are never 'done'
