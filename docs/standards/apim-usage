Azure API Management (APIM) is used to provide an API management layer and API Gateway for Ofqual. 

By using Azure APIM Ofqual can 
- Simplify and secure access to APIs 
- Monitor performance and usage 
- Make backend services easier to update and maintain 

Azure APIM acts as an API Gateway, providing a single entry-point into Ofqual APIs. 
Each environment will contain an Azure APIM instance within its own subnet, leveraging network isolation and secure controlled access for internal and external API consumers.
